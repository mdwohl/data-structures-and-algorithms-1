# Challenge Summary
Jack and I worked together on his repo to complete Code Challenge 7. We spent around an hour whiteboarding and about an hour on the code itself. 

## Challenge Description
Write a method that takes in an integer. Iterate over a linked list, and find the value contained within that is k spaces from the end of the list. Return this value.

## Approach & Efficiency
Our whiteboard laid out our steps pretty clearly. We were able to come up with a problem domain, algorithm, and pseudocode that made sense and was helpful guiding us.
I had a hard time understanding the visual at first.

## Solution
